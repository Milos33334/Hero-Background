    <h1>Visit Hong Kong</h1>
<p>There is truly no modern city more beautiful and exciting than Hong Kong: its skyline is a vertical playground of steel and glass skyscrapers – including landmark buildings by I.M. Pei, Sir Norman Foster and Cesar Pelli – iced in a rainbow of neon lights and silhouetted against towering green mountain peaks. Cutting through the centre is Victoria Harbour, criss-crossed with tiny wooden sampans, busy commuter ferries and container-laden super-ships, a daily reminder of Hong Kong's rich seafaring heritage. West of the scene lies the shimmering South China Sea, sweeping out into the far distance past inky outlying islands – remnants of the city’s previous incarnation as a backwater fishing village less than a century ago.Visitors will find everything they could possibly want from a city break at their fingertips – dazzling architecture, fantastic food, excellent shopping and banging nightlife. Be sure to sleep on the flight over: you’ll need all the energy you can muster to check off all the sights.</p>
